    "### Notebook 1 — From raw trajectories to visit-level events\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 1 establishes the data foundation. Starting from the original Geolife `.plt` files, it performs a series of spatial and temporal transformations to convert noisy GPS logs into a clean visit-level dataset. Raw points are first loaded and cleaned, then restricted to the Beijing study area and projected into a 500 m UTM grid that smooths GPS jitter and provides a common spatial reference. Night-time observations are used to infer the user’s primary home location (HOME) and a secondary frequent place (SW), while line–grid intersections identify grid cells that are genuinely “visited” rather than simply passed through in transit. Finally, consecutive points within the same activity cell are collapsed into **visit events**, each labelled as HOME, SW, first-time place (Pv), or return place (Pn), together with timing, distance-from-home, and within-day order attributes.  \n",

    "- **SW** – Second-strongest night-time cell after removing HOME (e.g. workplace / dorm).\n",
    "- **Activity cell** – Grid cell that is crossed by “enough” line segments in a day; road-only cells are excluded.\n",
    "- **Visit (visit-level event)** – Continuous stay in the same activity cell; consecutive points merged, short GPS gaps bridged.\n",

    "### Notebook 2 — Trip-level behaviour within a single user\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 2 takes the visit-level table for one user and reconstructs complete home–home trips. Visits are grouped into outings that start at HOME, move through one or more non-home stops, and end when HOME is reached again (or the day ends). Within each trip, the notebook analyses two key dimensions of behaviour.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, it estimates a discrete-time hazard of going home: for each stop order \\(k\\), it measures the probability that the next move is a return to HOME, conditional on the trip having already reached stop \\(k\\). This yields both empirical hazard and survival curves and a simple logit trend in stop order. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it models the propensity for exploration by tracking when first-time places (Pv) occur along the sequence of stops, and fitting a logistic regression of the Pv indicator on within-trip stop order. Together, these components characterise whether a trip is a short one-stop errand or a longer outing, and how the balance between revisiting known places and exploring new ones evolves as the trip unfolds.\n",

    "### Notebook 3 — Cross-user comparison of daily exploration patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 3 extends the analysis from a single individual to a panel of long-coverage Geolife users. For each user in the sample, it reloads the corresponding visit-level table, re-attaches the same home–home trip structure as in Notebook 2, and computes a compact set of trip-level and behavioural summaries: number of active days and trips, distribution of non-home stops per trip, user-specific going-home hazards, and within-trip exploration rates. The notebook then fits separate discrete-time logit models for the going-home hazard and the Pv probability for each user, producing a small set of interpretable parameters that describe their overall level of “home-boundness” and their tendency to explore as trips grow longer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, these features are combined into a multivariate “trip behaviour space”, where users are compared and clustered into broad types (e.g. errand-oriented, revisiting-oriented, or exploratory roamers). In this way, Notebook 3 acts as a cross-sectional validation of the patterns identified in Notebooks 1 and 2 and shows how similar or heterogeneous daily exploration behaviour is across individuals.\n",
