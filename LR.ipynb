    "This project analyzes high-resolution Geolife GPS trajectories by representing everyday mobility as a sequence of discrete visit events linked into home-based trips. Each non-home stop is labeled as either a first-time place or a return place to quantify exploration versus revisitation within and across trips. Using these labeled sequences, I estimate how the likelihood of returning home and the propensity to explore evolve with stop order and compare these patterns across users."

    "## 1. What is EPR?\n",
    "We examine everyday movement as a balance between revisiting familiar places and exploring new ones. In behavioral terms, most people follow habitual travel routines (e.g., home–work–home) yet occasionally deviate to novel destinations. This “exploit vs. explore” trade-off can be framed by an Exploration–Preferencing Ratio (EPR): a higher EPR means more exploration of new sites relative to returning to known ones. Conceptually, EPR is analogous to the exploration-and-preferential-return model in human mobility research, in which at each move an agent either visits a new location or returns to a past one (Pappalardo, Rinzivillo, & Simini, 2016; Song, Koren, Wang, & Barabási, 2010). Large-scale visitation patterns have been shown to arise from EPR-like dynamics in empirical data (Schläpfer et al., 2021; Song, Qu, Blumm, & Barabási, 2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "In mobility data, we treat EPR operationally as the ratio of novel stops to repeated stops. For example, if a trip includes three previously unvisited stops (exploration) and one repeated stop, the person’s trip-level EPR would be 3:1, indicating exploratory behavior. In our context, we adapt this idea to individual GPS trajectories by explicitly labelling each stop as either “Pv” (previously visited) or “Pn” (novel), and then modeling the patterns of Pv/Pn occurrences within trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our data, we operationalize this by labelling each non-home stop as Pn (novel) if it is the first time the user has stopped at that particular location, or Pv (visited) if it falls at a location the user has visited before. Over a trip (home → … → home), we then summarize the trip’s exploratory tendency by, for example, the count of Pn stops or the ratio Pn/(Pv + Pn). A person’s overall EPR can be aggregated from their trips (e.g., average per-trip exploration rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "This trip-focused EPR differs from classic probabilistic models (e.g., the EPR model of Song et al., 2010) in that we measure empirical behavior rather than impose a fixed probability of exploration (Song et al., 2010). Prior literature has examined related metrics: Pappalardo et al. (2015), for instance, show that individuals cluster into “explorers” (many new locations) or “returners” (few new locations) based on visit-count ratios. Our approach is similar in spirit but works at the granularity of trips and discrete stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also draw on ecological ideas of foraging: just as people navigating information maximize an information-gain rate by choosing to explore “new patches” only when the expected gain outweighs the cost (Pirolli & Card, 1999; Nielsen, 2019), travelers may implicitly weigh the novelty of a potential stop against its travel or time cost. We do not explicitly model that decision rule, but the EPR encapsulates its outcome. In short, EPR is the key behavioral concept linking individual choices of revisiting vs. exploring, and our goal is to measure it from trajectory data."

    "## 2. From EPR Concept to Empirical Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the EPR idea, the remainder of the project focuses on how exploration and returning behaviour unfold within trips and how these patterns vary across individuals. Rather than treating mobility purely as a set of locations, I treat it as an ordered sequence of stops and decisions, which makes it possible to ask step-by-step questions such as: When do trips tend to end? and At what point in a trip do new places become more likely?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the trip level, I summarize outings by their length (number of non-home stops) and spatial reach (distance from HOME), and then examine the next-step dynamics after each stop. This enables a clear separation between short, errand-like trips (often ending quickly) and longer outings in which individuals remain out and continue chaining stops. In parallel, I quantify exploration by tracking the share of first-time stops within trips and how that share changes as a trip progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the analysis scales up to a cross-user setting. For a set of long-coverage users, I compute comparable trip and exploration summaries and estimate user-specific parameters that capture both (i) overall levels of going home and exploration and (ii) how these tendencies change with stop order. These user-level profiles support systematic cross-user comparisons and allow the identification of broad behavioural types (e.g., frequent errand trips versus fewer but more exploratory outings)."
