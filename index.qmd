## About me

I’m Jingqi (Luciano) Lu. This site is a notebook-style project using Geolife GPS trajectories to build visit events, reconstruct home-based trips, and summarize within-trip “going home” and exploration patterns.

## Notebooks

- Notebook 0: Overview  
- Notebook 1: Data cleaning → visit-level table (HOME/SW, Pv/Pn, visits)  
- Notebook 2: Trip reconstruction and within-trip behaviour (next-step, hazard/survival, Pv trend)  
- Notebook 3: Cross-user checks (user summaries, hazard/Pv curves, clustering)  
- Notebook 4: Conclusion (key findings, limitations, next steps)
- Reference

## Data and outputs

Data: Microsoft Research Geolife GPS trajectories.  
Main output files include `visit_level_table_XXX.csv`, plus trip summaries and fitted parameters produced in later notebooks.

## Reproducibility

Run notebooks top-to-bottom. If needed, update paths under the `Geolife Trajectories 1.3/` folder.
