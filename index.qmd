title: "Geolife Daily Mobility"
---

Welcome!

This mini site presents an exploratory case study of daily mobility using
the Geolife GPS trajectories. The analysis is organised into five main
notebooks:

- **Notebook 0 - Overview**  
  What is EPR and structure of the study.

- **Notebook 1 – Data cleaning**  
  From raw Geolife trajectories to a visit-level table: loading `.plt`
  files, filtering to Beijing, projecting to a 500 m grid, and detecting
  home / stay locations.

- **Notebook 2 – Trips by action**  
  Builds home–home trips from visit events, then studies within-trip
  behaviour, including the discrete-time hazard of going home and the
  probability of visiting new places (Pv).

- **Notebook 3 – Cross-user verification**  
  Extends the trip-level analysis to multiple long-coverage users, compares
  going-home hazards and exploration profiles, and clusters users into
  behavioural types.

- **Findings and conclusion**  
  Summarises the main empirical patterns and discusses which aspects of
  daily mobility appear systematic at the population level and which are
  strongly user-specific.
