    "The individual-level modelling in Notebook 2 and the cross-user analysis in Notebook 3 together clarify which features of daily mobility exhibit robust population structure and which are strongly heterogeneous across individuals. Rather than revisiting implementation details, this section focuses on the behavioural regularities that emerge from the Geolife sample.\n",

    "## Population-level behavioural structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all long-coverage Geolife users, daily mobility is systematically organised into short, home-anchored trips rather than long, continuous journeys. Most movement takes the form of repeated “home → one or several non-home stops → home” sequences. This pattern confirms that home–home trips, defined as sequences of non-home visits bracketed by home, are an appropriate structural unit for describing everyday mobility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within these trips, the dynamics of trip termination are clearly not universal. The discrete-time hazard analysis shows substantial heterogeneity in the shape of the going-home curve. Some users display a pronounced peak in the probability of returning home at the first non-home stop; others exhibit only a modest difference between the first stop and subsequent stops; and for a smaller subset the highest hazards occur later in the trip. What appears to generalise across users is not the location of a single peak, but the broader pattern that, once a trip continues beyond the first few stops, the probability of ending it typically settles into a comparatively low and stable regime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploration behaviour, measured by first-time place visits (Pv), shows an equally diverse set of trajectories. For many users, the probability that a non-home stop is a new place increases with stop order within the trip, indicating that exploration tends to be concentrated in the middle and later stages of an outing. For others, the Pv probability is nearly flat across stop orders, suggesting that their trips consist predominantly of revisits to familiar locations. These findings support the use of stop order as a meaningful explanatory axis for exploration decisions, while at the same time rejecting any single “universal” Pv curve (such as a strictly monotonic increase) as a plausible population-level law.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multivariate summary of trip counts, stop counts, hazards and exploration rates further indicates that users do not form a homogeneous behavioural population. Clustering in this feature space yields three coherent mobility types that can be interpreted as: users who undertake relatively long, multi-stop trips concentrated in familiar places; users who make shorter, errand-like trips with relatively high early termination; and users who go out less frequently but, when they do, remain away from home longer and visit new places more intensively. These three groups occupy distinct regions in principal-component space, which suggests that the observed heterogeneity is structured rather than driven by noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, the cross-user results depict daily mobility as a system with a shared backbone and substantial individual differentiation. The shared backbone lies in the decomposition of behaviour into home–home trips and in the stabilisation of ending probabilities once a trip is underway. The individual differentiation lies in how strongly early stops matter, how exploration evolves along the trip, and how each person combines revisiting and novelty. It is precisely this combination of common structure and user-specific variation that characterises the population-level mobility patterns in the Geolife data.\n"
