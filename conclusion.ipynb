    "# Results and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 2 (within-user modelling) and Notebook 3 (cross-user comparison) together show which aspects of daily mobility are common across people and which vary substantially between individuals. This section therefore emphasises the behavioural patterns implied by the Geolife sample, rather than the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Population-level behavioural structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Across long-coverage users, a consistent structural pattern appears: daily movement is organised into short, home-anchored outings rather than long, continuous trajectories. Most observed behaviour can be represented as sequences of HOME → non-home stop(s) → HOME, supporting the use of home–home trips (non-home visits bracketed by home) as a meaningful unit for describing everyday mobility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Heterogeneity in trip termination (“going home”)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the home–home structure is shared, how trips end differs sharply across users. The discrete-time hazard curves show substantial heterogeneity in both level and shape. Many users exhibit a pronounced one-stop errand effect—a high probability of returning home immediately after the first non-home stop—whereas others show a weaker early spike. A smaller subset display relatively higher hazards later in the trip, though these late-trip patterns often coincide with sparse data at large stop orders. The most consistent population-level feature is that, once a trip extends beyond the first few stops, the probability of returning home typically drops and stabilises at a lower level, rather than continuing to rise steadily with trip length.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Heterogeneity in exploration (first-time places, Pv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploration behaviour is also diverse. For many users, the probability that a stop is a first-time place (Pv) increases with stop order, implying that novelty-seeking tends to occur after the outing has already continued for multiple stops (i.e., mid- to late-trip exploration). For other users, Pv probability is nearly flat across stop order, consistent with trips dominated by revisits to familiar locations. Overall, stop order is a useful axis for explaining exploration dynamics, but there is no single universal Pv curve that fits everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. User typology and systematic differences\n",
    "\n",
    "When trip frequency, trip complexity (stops per trip), going-home parameters, and exploration parameters are combined into a multivariate profile, users do not form a single homogeneous group. Clustering in this feature space consistently separates three behavioural types: (1) multi-stop revisitors, characterised by longer trips with low exploration; (2) errand-oriented users, characterised by high first-stop return probabilities and shorter outings; and (3) exploratory roamers, characterised by fewer outings but comparatively stronger exploration conditional on being out. Their separation in PCA space suggests that these differences reflect systematic behavioural variation, not only random sampling noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Daily mobility in Geolife therefore shows a clear shared backbone—movement structured into home–home trips and a tendency for “going home” probabilities to settle into a lower regime after early stops—alongside substantial, interpretable individual differences. The strongest sources of differentiation are (i) the strength of the one-stop errand pattern, (ii) whether exploration increases with stop order, and (iii) how users balance novelty against routine across trips."
